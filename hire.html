      <p>I am self-employed and make a living from training, mentoring, and freelancing. The ways I can be of service to you are usually through:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mentoring.</strong> If, as a developer, you are "stuck" in some critical issue with RxJS, RxJava, reactive programming, functional programming in JavaScript, or Cycle.js, I can help you with a short mentoring session over a video-call. Contact me preferably through <a href="https://www.codementor.io/staltz">Codementor</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Training.</strong> If, as a team of developers in Europe, you need a workshop about RxJS, RxJava, reactive programming, functional programming in JavaScript, or Cycle.js, I can organize a training day (or two) in person with the team. I have executed two such trainings in the past, and customers were satisfied. Contact me preferably by <a href="mailto:andre@staltz.com">email</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Contract work.</strong> My availability for projects is at the moment insufficient. I recommend checking again in the autumn of 2017.<br /><strike>If your software project needs a senior developer with experience in RxJS, RxJava, reactive programming, functional programming, Cycle.js, React Native, React, or frontend architecture, I am likely to help you by committing a few weeks or months to solving your problems. Contact me preferably by <a href="mailto:andre@staltz.com">email</a></strike>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For other types of work, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:andre@staltz.com">email</a> and we can discuss the details and viability.</p>

      <p><em>I worked closely with André while developing a kick-ass application for Android. As a designer I appreciate his ability to jump into my shoes and have a vivid conversation about any issue - was it design or technical detail. Practically everything was possible to him, but of course with consideration. I have worked wit only a couple of developers I consider to be truly top-class and André is surely one of them!</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrestaltz/">&mdash; Ville Suomi</a></p>

      <p><em>André is one of the most brilliant researchers I met in the entire research group. The way he thinks and tackles the problems always give me an unique impression. I recommend André to his future employee/employer or his business partner not only because he is good at having actionable insights on different problems, but also he is a really nice guy to hang out.</em> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrestaltz/">&mdash; Hotloo Xiranood</a></p>

      <p><em>I feel like an Rx god already. Thanks Andre.</em> <a href="https://www.codementor.io/staltz">&mdash; Akinsanmi on Codementor</a></p>

      <p><em>Andre was extremely patient, very respectful, and extremely insightful. He helped me understand how to think reactively, and although we were short for time, he pointed me in the right direction for where to go next. I would 100% recommend to anybody who needs help with Rx.</em> <a href="https://www.codementor.io/staltz">&mdash; Raimondo on Codementor</a></p>
